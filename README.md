# MPF-HBS: Multi-Person Forecasting on Handball Shot
Official repository for the paper with title "Analysis of Multi-Person Pose Forecasting Models on Handball Actions"

> Multi-person pose forecasting involves predicting the future poses of multiple individuals within a scene, which is crucial for various applications in sports analytics, surveillance, human-computer interaction, etc. This paper investigates multi-person pose forecasting models in the context of handball actions, presenting a comprehensive analysis through two main experiments. Firstly, we evaluate pre-trained models on a custom dataset of handball shots to assess their applicability in real-world scenarios. Secondly, we analyze model performance on the same handball shot dataset after fine-tuning, emphasizing domain adaptation effects. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset for multi-person pose forecasting, featuring scenarios where two players execute handball shots. This dataset fills a critical gap by providing a specialized and dynamic environment for evaluating pose forecasting models. The experiments highlight the effectiveness of transfer learning and domain adaptation strategies in enhancing model accuracy and robustness for real-world applications involving complex human interactions and movements.

The code for this paper will be made available soon.
